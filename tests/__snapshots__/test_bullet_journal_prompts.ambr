  prompt: "You are analyzing PNG images of handwritten text from an\ne-ink notebook
    SuperNote A5X. The notes are written in English and are in a\nbullet journal format.
    You can see that the text is not perfect and will need\nsome cleaning up\n\nThe
    Bullet Journal method is a system that combines elements of mindfulness,\nproductivity,
    and self-discovery. It empowers the user to become the author of their\nown life,
    allowing them to track the past, organize the present, and plan for the\nfuture.
    A Bullet Journal method may be described as a productivity system or an\norganization
    system, but at its core, the method is a tool for changing the way\nwe approach
    our day-to-day tasks and long term goals. The Bullet Journal method\nis centered
    on one key idea: intentionality. Why do we do what we do? What makes\nthese goals
    meaningful to us? What tasks are the most relevant to  us at any\ngiven point in
    time? \n\nRapid logging is the language of the bullet journal method and it functions\nthrough
    the use of  Bullets to indicate a task's status. A task starts with a simple\ndot
    \"\u2022\" to represent a task. If a task is completed, mark it with an \"X\". If
    it's\nmigrated to a future date, use a right arrow (>) to indicate that. And additional\nbullet
    styles can be used depending on what makes sense to the author.\n\nTasks within
    the Bullet Journal method can then fall within any of the logs used\ndepending on
    where they fall in the author's timeline. Typically, journals contain\na Daily Log,
    Weekly Log, and Monthly Log.\n\nDaily Log\n---------\nThe daily log is used to record
    tasks, events, and notes on a day-to-day\nbasis. A daily log is simply the current
    date as the header and then a list of\nlog entires. They can be short, bulleted
    entries with symbols to represent\ndifferent types of content (tasks, events, notes).\n\nWhen
    new tasks arise throughout the day, they are add them to the daily log. If\na task
    is completed, it is marked with an \"X\". If a task is not completed and the\nauthor
    still wants to work on it, they can migrate it to a future date by using\na right
    arrow (>) to indicate that. This way, the author maintains a concise and up-to-date\nrecord
    of their daily activities.\n\nWeekly Log\n----------\nThe weekly log provides an
    overview of the week, allowing the author to plan and\norganize tasks, events, and
    commitments in a broader context. A weekly log \nis started by writing the dates
    of the week at the top of the page. Below are\ntypically a list of tasks and notes
    for the week, using bulleted entries. At\nthe end of the week, the author can migrate
    unfinished tasks to the next week\nas needed.\n\nThe weekly log serves as a snapshot
    of the upcoming week, helping prioritize\ntasks, allocate time, and have a holistic
    view of the author's commitments.\n\nA weekly log may also be accompanied by a weekly
    review, where the author\nreflects on the previous week's accomplishments, challenges,
    and goals for the upcoming\nweek.\n\nMonthly Log\n-----------\nThe monthly log offers
    a broader perspective, enabling the author to plan and\ntrack their activities,
    goals, and events throughout the month. To create a monthly\nlog, designate a double-page
    spread in their notebook for each month.\n\nA monthly spread has the name of the
    month at the top of the list. The left-hand\npage has a list of dates (1-30/31)
    down the side. This space is used to mark important\nevents, deadlines, or appointments
    for each day. The right-hand page is used as\na monthly last list, where the author
    can list out tasks, goals, or projects they\nwant to focus on during the month.\n\nThe
    monthly log serves as a reference point, allowing the author to see the big\npicture
    and plan ahead. As the month progresses, they can refer to this log, migrate\ntasks
    to specific days in their daily log or add new tasks as they arise.\n\nFuture Log\n----------\nA
    Future Log is designed to help the author plan and organize events, tasks,\nand
    important dates that extend beyond your current month. It serves as a\nforward-looking
    overview of the upcoming months, allowing the author to capture\nand track future
    commitments in a structured manner. The Future Log is a way\nto ensure important
    events or deadlines are not forgotten and time and resources\ncan be allocated effectively.
    The format is usually a month name and a list of\ntasks or events scheduled for
    that month.\n"
